# Binomial and Normal distributions converge in the large N limit

## See file "Visual Demo for graphical representations"

The the Binomial and Normal distributions converge in the large N limit due to the ideas outlined in the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT states that if we have a collection if random and independent observations and we take the mean of these values, the probability distribution of the values will be the standard normal distribution if our number of values (n) is large enough. Looking at the visual representations, we see that with a smaller number of observations, the curve does not reflect that of a normal distribution. However, when we increase n for the normal and binomial data, we see that the curve begins to reflect the normal distribution (symetrical, bell-shaped).
